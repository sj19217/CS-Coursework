## Things to do:
* Remove get_start_address() from UML diagram for instructions

## Possible tests to implement
* Incorrect section names
* Missing section
* A meta section config option that should not exist
* Middle and borderline tests between data types for immediate values
* Lots of tests on different sizes of immediate values + floats

## General improvements
* Rather than just raising errors, have a proper "assembly failed on line ...:" message
